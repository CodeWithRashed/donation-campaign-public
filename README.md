# Donation Campaign App

Welcome to the Donation Campaign App. We have organized various donation campaigns to help people in need. You can choose and donate to any campaign you wish to support.

## Features

**1. Donation Details Page**
 - Each donation campaign has a dedicated page where users can learn more about the ongoing campaign and its details.
 
**2. Donated Campaign List**
- Users can easily track the campaigns they have donated to through a list.

**3. Search Campaigns by Category**
- Find and support campaigns based on specific categories, making it easy to contribute to causes you care about.

**4. Donation Statistics**
- Users have access to their donation history and can see how much they have contributed. The app provides a visual representation of donation goals with a pie chart.

**5. User Notifications with Toasts**
- Toast notifications provide users with updates and confirmation messages on their donation actions.

## Additional Knowledge

In addition to the mentioned features, the Donation Campaign App incorporates the following technologies and concepts:

- **Local Storage:** Local storage is used to store and manage user-related data, such as their donation history and preferences.
- **Toast Notifications:** The app uses toast notifications to provide users with real-time feedback and information.
- **Handling 404 Routes:** Proper handling of 404 routes ensures a seamless user experience by managing cases where a requested page or route doesn't exist.

This project serves as a practical example of a web application with user-focused features, data management using local storage, real-time notifications with toasts, and proper route handling for enhanced user experience.
